# WeRateDogs-data-wrangling
This repo contains files used for completion of the WeRateDogs data wrangling assignment as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

The requirement was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. It required
accessing three different data sources: a .csv file, a .tsv file downloaded programmatically of image prediction outcomes from a neural
network, and additional tweet-related data secured from the Twitter API. The data then needed to be visually and programmaticall assessed
for quality and tidiness issues, before using code to address these issues and test their application. A resultant master clean dataframe 
merging the three sources needed to be created, and as a final requirement, some basic analysis and visualization needed to be completed.
